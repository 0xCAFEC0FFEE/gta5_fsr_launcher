# [FSR](https://github.com/NarutoUA/gta5_fsr)/ENB Launcher for GTA V

Launches GTA V/RagePluginHook and instantly injects [D3D-Hijacker](https://github.com/alessandromrc/D3D-Hijacker), which loads custom d3d11.dll and/or dxgi.dll instead of the default ones by hooking LoadLibraryA.

To install, place built executables & fsr_dxhijack.dll into the game's root directory.
